Call your favorite Pizza Establishment and see what promo deals are available
decide What deal best fits your need and order your pizza
pay through the customer service representative / portal
always tip your driver to ensure safe delivery and good Karma
if they deliver the wrong order be sure to call back immediately and let them know
they can't reserve pizzas so if the driver doesn't want it you got a free Pizza
Be stern but polite with the manager on the phone, if you take it easy and make them laugh you can usually get another free Pizza off them
now that you have a potential 2-3 pizzas at your disposal, be sure to all up your friends for a Halo 2 LAN party like its 2008 all over again
